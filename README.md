# Sasaek Mini – Perfect Pixel Developer Task

This is my implementation of MUST's Perfect Pixel Developer challenge. The goal was to accurately translate a Figma design into a responsive, pixel-perfect web page using modern front-end technologies.

## 🔗 Live Demo

## ✨ Key Features

- **Pixel-perfect implementation** based on the provided Figma design.
- **Responsive layout** that adapts seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Language translation** powered by `i18next` and `i18next-browser-languagedetector`.
- **Dynamic language switcher** integrated into the navbar.
- **Accessible and semantic HTML** structure.
- **Clean component structure** for scalability and maintainability.


## 🧠 Why i18next?

The Figma file was originally in Korean and included a language selection dropdown. To reflect real-world UX expectations, I integrated whole-language translation using `i18next`, allowing the interface to switch dynamically between Korean, Japanese, and English.

This feature ensures the UI is inclusive, scalable, and ready for localisation.


## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** (with Vite)
- **Framer-motion** (for animation)
- **Vanilla CSS**
- **i18next** (for internationalisation)
- **Vercel** (for deployment)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)
